                            This project has been developed to provide digital and secure access to university laboratories. Currently, access to laboratories is often managed manually, leading to both time inefficiencies and potential security vulnerabilities. The goal of this project is to digitize these processes, offering a faster and more secure access system.

                            Through the mobile application to be developed, students will be able to request appointments for laboratory access. Using the app, students can view real-time occupancy data for laboratories and book available time slots. Appointment requests will be reviewed and approved by laboratory administrators. Once approved, students can unlock laboratory doors using either NFC (Near Field Communication) or QR code technology. Both NFC and QR code scanning will be performed easily via their smartphones.
                        </p>
                        <p class="project-description">
                            This system will streamline the access process and enhance security. Laboratory doors will be equipped with sensors to monitor whether they are properly closed. If necessary, the doors will automatically lock, ensuring security. Additionally, real-time occupancy tracking will allow students to choose suitable time slots, ensuring efficient use of laboratory resources.

                            On the server side, the system will handle student requests and manage approval workflows for administrators. The hardware will include NFC readers and QR code scanners, integrated to enable the automated opening and closing of laboratory doors. All these processes will be supported by a secure and user-friendly interface, establishing a more modern and efficient access system for university laboratories.

                            In addition, I have taken on the role of DevOps Engineer in this project, focusing on virtualization efforts using technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Nginx. I have worked to containerize and orchestrate application components, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficient resource utilization. By implementing these modern DevOps practices, I contributed to creating a robust infrastructure that supports seamless deployment, high availability, and streamlined management of the system. My efforts have played a crucial role in ensuring the project's technical foundation aligns with its goals of security, speed, and efficiency.
